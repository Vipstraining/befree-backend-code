## Error Response Structure

```typescript

  success: false;
  message: string;
  errors?: ValidationError[];
}

interface ValidationError {
  field: string;
  message: string;
  value?: any;
}
```

## Language Guidelines

All text content follows these principles:
- **Simple Language**: "Good for you" instead of "beneficial"
- **Friendly Tone**: Conversational and approachable
- **Everyday Words**: "Energy" instead of "calories" when talking to users
- **Clear Benefits**: "Good for your heart" instead of "cardiovascular benefits"
- **Practical Advice**: Actionable recommendations users can follow

## Frontend Integration Notes

1. **Always check `success` field** before accessing `searchResult`
2. **Handle `isFallback` flag** - show appropriate messaging when true
3. **Display `simpleSummary`** as the main headline
4. **Use `healthImpact`** for color coding (positive=green, caution=yellow, etc.)
5. **Show `score`** as a visual indicator (0-100 scale)
6. **Display arrays** as bullet points or cards
7. **Handle empty arrays** gracefully (recommendations, warnings, benefits)
